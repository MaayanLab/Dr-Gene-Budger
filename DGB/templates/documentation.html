    <p><u>Abstract</u></p>
    <p>
        Mechanistic molecular studies in biomedical research often discover important genes that are aberrantly
        expressed in disease. However, manipulating these genes’ expression to attempt to improve the disease state is
        challenging. Here we present Dr. Gene Budger (DGB), a web-based application developed to assist investigators
        with prioritizing small molecules that are predicted to maximally influence the expression of their gene of
        interest. With DGB users can enter a gene symbol, and whether they wish to upregulate or downregulate its
        expression. The output of the application is a ranked list of small molecules that have been experimentally
        determined to produce the desired expression effect. The table includes log-transformed fold changes and
        p-values for each small molecule, reporting the significance of differential expression as determined by the
        limma method [1]. Relevant links are provided to further explore knowledge about the target gene, the small
        molecule, and the source of evidence from which the relationship between the small molecule and the target gene
        as derived. The experimental data contained within DGB is compiled from signatures extracted from the LINCS
        L1000 dataset and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [2, 3]. DGB provides a useful preliminary technique for
        identifying small molecules that can target the expression of  single genes in mammalian cells.
